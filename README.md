# A nameless GUI library for building apps

**Mode**: immediate
**Backend**: sokol
**Tested on**: windows
**Visual style inspired by**: https://ui.shadcn.com/
**Hotel**: Trivago

## Design theory

This is not a framework, there is no immediate-mode DOM, this library only provides layer and layout stacks along with procedures for initializing and displaying widgets.

My goal for this library is that less would be more; provide the user with sufficient low-level procedures that any layout is possible with a little cleverness.

## Plans

Once I deem the library stable, all the necessary widgets are added and I have a complete demo, I will test it on Linux and Android.
