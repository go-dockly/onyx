# Onyx

- **Mode**: immediate
- **Backend**: sokol
- **Tested on**: windows and linux amd64
- **Visual style inspired by**: https://ui.shadcn.com/
- **Hotel**: trivago

## Design theory

This is not a framework, there is no immediate-mode DOM, this library only provides layer and layout stacks along with procedures for initializing and displaying widgets.  The visual style is more-less fixed with only color schemes, fonts and some layout settings being mutable.  This is designed specifically for my own desktop apps.

My goal for this library is that less would be more; provide the user with sufficient low-level procedures that any layout is possible with a little cleverness.

## Plans

Once the library is more or less complete and the demo serves as a complete exhibit of all its features, I plan to test this on Android.
